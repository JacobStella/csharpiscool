// welcome to the oh so fun level one!

// this is a comment, anything after the // on the same line is ignored by the compiler (thing that turns code into a program that actually does stuff)


// this is a class, dont worry about what that means for now, just know that everything in c# has to be inside a class
class Program
{
    // this is the main function, this is where the program starts running
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // this prints whatever is inside the parentheses to the console (your terminal)
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}

// lets run this code. Now that we have the extentions installed we can click the arrow on the top right or click f5. You should see a terminal pop up that says "Hello, World!"
